#3 functions in this file: algorithms for lines, sentences, and substrings

# Implement lines in such a way that, given two strings, a and b, it returns a list of the lines that are, identically, in both a and b.
# The list should not contain any duplicates. Assume that lines in a and b will be be separated by \n,
# but the strings in the returned list should not end in \n. If both a and b contain
# one or more blank lines (i.e., a \n immediately preceded by no other characters), the returned list should include an empty string (i.e., "").
